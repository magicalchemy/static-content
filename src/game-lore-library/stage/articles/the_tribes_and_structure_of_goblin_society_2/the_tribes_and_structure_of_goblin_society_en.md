# The tribes and structure of goblin society


The ancient state and homeland of the goblins fell during the war with Adomion. The goblins’ great treasures, knowledge, and heritage were lost forever. The war with the Mad God and the following cataclysms took most of Mendelef’s children.

Some of the last great goblin alchemists, who still remembered the majesty and beauty of the ancient state, swore on their blood that until the great prophecy was fulfilled, the goblin people would not find a new homeland. This oath has driven the goblin people for hundreds and thousands of years in a never-ending search for the artifacts of a bygone era and the truth hidden in the prophecy.

Since the Survivor Wars, the goblins have remained a small minority. They have spread out across some of the lands of the Khela and Farnax continents and formed several tribes.

## Tribal structure. Buhlag

The goblin society is divided into five groups, which are called buhlags. Buhlag is an association of goblins with its traditions and rules. It is a mixture of caste structure and craft guilds.

Goblins who reach the age of twelve decide which craft they will pursue as adults. And, accordingly, which buhlag they want to join.

### Pickers

Buhlag members grow produce, raise livestock, and pick the necessary ingredients to make alchemical potions. The most renowned picking buhlags toil in a tribe of woodland goblins. Due to the magical nature of the elven forest, only here do plants grow from which unique alchemical ingredients are extracted.

### Artisans

This group is responsible for the economic life of the goblin tribe. Blacksmiths, builders, tailors, and other craftsmen are members of this buhlag. The darhans, masters of making and repairing alchemical objects, occupy a particularly honorable place in this buhlag. Only experienced smiths become darhans. The most skillful darhans come from the Zuun Merkat tribe. They travel with trade caravans in their workshop wagons. Every goblin settlement has a job for them to mend alchemical tools.

### Traders

Goblin traders play an important role in tribal life. They keep in touch and trade with the other peoples of the Dji’Da world. This buhlag consists of small shopkeepers trading on the street and merchants outfitting large trade caravans to all countries.

The most respected buhlag is located in the kingdom of Ankorlan. The local goblins ask to be called the Trade Guild, like humans. The Trade Guild created and ran the Goblin Bank, known far beyond the kingdom’s borders.

### Alchemists

This group, though few, is the most important in the goblin tribe, for alchemy has sacred meaning among Mendelef’s children. Over the millennia, the talent of alchemy and its power has become rarer among the children of Mendelef. That is why goblins in whom this talent is found always become members of the alchemists’ buhlag.

There are many fields in which an alchemist works, from perfumery and medicine to the manufacture of magical elixirs.

### Sentinels

Among goblins, thousands of years ago, there was a group responsible for protecting their people. If you know of any stories that feature a warrior or spy of the goblin race, you can rest assured that this goblin was a sentinel.

Protecting trade caravans from brigands and ensuring order in goblin settlements is the sentinels’ concern. It was among the sentinels that the Order of Truth Seekers arose, whose members devoted their lives to service in the name of the Great Prophecy and the search for ancient goblin artifacts.

## Goblin Tribes
### The Lonely Moon Tribe

They are representatives of the northern lands of the continent of Farnax. They have several settlements spread across the vast territory of the kingdoms of the north of Bayan’Gol and Sandorn. They are on good terms with the dwarves of Bayan’Gol, often trading with them, exchanging their potions for dwarven tools and other goods.

A particularly revered buhlag in this tribe are the sentinels. The constant danger and threats from the proximity of the lands of the Northern Orcish Horde have made the Lone Moon tribe the most militant and courageous goblins in Dji’Da. The Lone Moon is the only goblin tribe that sent its sentinels to the Three Swords War. It also supplied many field hospitals with restorative potions and other healing elixirs.

### The Forest Goblin Tribe

These are the goblins who found their shelter in the forests of Adrienne. They settled in the eastern forests of the elven kingdom over a thousand years ago. This was the only time the elves allowed anyone to settle in their lands.

This fact makes the forest goblins the most numerous of all the tribes. Elves have become a reliable source of protection and prosperity for the forest goblin tribe. The unique magical plants growing in these forests serve as excellent raw materials for elixirs. And there is no better beauty product on the entire continent than the herbal elixirs of the wood goblins. The court ladies of all the kingdoms and princedoms are ready to lay out mountains of gold for the opportunity to use them.

### The Vala’as Hina Tribe

A tribe of goblins settled in the kingdom of Ankorlan. In its capital, Gabar, goblins live in a small area. It is outside the boundaries of the old city, as fires caused by goblin experiments nearly burned the town down three hundred years ago.

After this tragedy, it was decided to move the area where the goblins might live outside the city walls, closer to the river Lostme. The magic academy of Ankorlan and the goblin alchemists’ guild have long cooperated in matters of magic and alchemy research. Free entrance to the academy is always open to goblin alchemists. Also in the capital is the main building of the Bank of Goblins. It is a financial institution widely known outside Ankorlan and has a lot of branches in many countries.

### The Zuun Merkat Tribe

These goblins live in the Seleng Mountains, on the border of the The Emirate of Eastern Balkh and the Dujun Empire. A long-standing friendship with the dwarves of the Iron Throne allowed the goblins to learn blacksmithing skills from the dwarves. Because of this, the smiths and dwarves of Zuun Merkat are considered the most skilled of all goblins.

The settlements are inhabited mainly by women, children, and older people. Most of the tribe’s men travel throughout the continent of Khela, sometimes even crossing the Great Sea to the neighboring continent of Farnax.

The traders and artisans of the tribe return to the Seleng Mountains only in late autumn, where they spend the winter with their families. They share remarkable stories of adventures, new lands they have seen, and prosperous trade deals. In winter, the alchemists of the tribe brew elixirs for trade from the ingredients the men bring back from their expeditions, and the artisans make new items for sale. As spring arrives, the men again embark on trading expeditions in search of fresh magical ingredients that the goblin people do not know yet.
