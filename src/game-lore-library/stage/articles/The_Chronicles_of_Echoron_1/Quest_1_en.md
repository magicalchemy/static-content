# Seeking the Truth
A small figure wrapped in a hooded cloak approached the large mansion on the hill. Before reaching the mansion's gate, the figure stopped and began to examine the massive and beautifully decorated gate leaves forged by a skilled blacksmith.

Gorl left the lands of his native tribe for the first time and looked at the unfamiliar scenery and buildings with great curiosity. The Order's mission took him to the most remote and northern lands, the Duchy of Dornkun, the capital city of Karrun.

So Gorl stood in front of the mansion of one of the principality's most influential and prosperous merchants. Sven Thorvalson, the mansion's owner, contacted the Truth Seekers and asked them to help him with a case.

Gorl had only recently become a member of the Seekers of Truth, an Order whose aim was to search for ancient goblin artifacts worldwide.
He was one of the few young goblins who dedicated his life to serving the great prophecy of his people. Many of Gorl's peers only ridiculed his choice when deciding on his path as an adult. 

Gorl had no talent for alchemy, so as a child, he was determined to join the ranks of the Truth Seekers.

It was due to the influence of his grandfather, who was also a Seekers member. Between expeditions, Grandpa would tell his grandson fascinating stories about his adventures and the amazing things he found.

Gorl spent many years studying the history, languages, and culture of all the races of the G'da world under the tutelage of the Order until he was accepted as a member of the Seekers of Truth. And so, on behalf of the Council of the Order, he arrived here.

Gorl was led to the merchant's private office, where Sven Thorvalson himself was waiting for him. He was an older, heavyset man dressed in a sumptuous, gold-embroidered gown. He sat at the massive, ornate table and looked intently at Gorl.

– Hello, Seeker. Let's leave everything superfluous behind and get right down to the business I have called you for. As you know, I am an avid collector of artifacts and treasures of the past. And now I've got a fascinating piece for my collection – Sven pulled a dark metal box from a drawer.

– This box belonged to the Dwarf King, Torm the Third, who lived over two thousand years ago. And don't ask me how much effort I had to put in to get it. I am curious to know what is hidden in it. 
The dwarf artisan who created the box has installed a clever security mechanism and enchanted it with the magical rune of the All-Devouring Flame, which will work if you try to open the box by force or with magical charms. A cipher is needed; no matter how hard I tried to find one, I failed.

I had given up hope of opening the box when I learned there was an Order of Truth-seekers among the goblins. You are the ones who have been searching for thousands of years for the ancient artifacts of your people. I'm sure the Order has broken into various treasuries, including those of the Dwarves, on more than one occasion. 

And you're the only one who can unlock this box, apart from the gnomes. However, given how zealous they are about everything that concerns their heritage, there is no point in asking them for help.

As a reward for your help, I will give you an artifact that belonged to the alchemists of old. So, what do you think about this?
 
– I am willing to try and help you. May I see the box, please? – Gorl carefully took it from Sven's hands and scrutinized it from all sides.

The box was a masterpiece of dwarven art. It was made of dark mithril, and each side was inscribed with a ligature of dwarven patterns inlaid with gems. 
The lid was decorated with gnome runes, and beneath them was the lock with rotating discs on which letters and pictograms were inscribed.

– Master Sven, I know why it didn't work out for you. It uses the language of an ancient human kingdom that disappeared during the Survivor Wars. The cipher itself is not complicated, and you just have to pick up the letters from the human alphabet and match them with the runes of the gnomes. The folded word will be the cipher to the lock.

Gorl typed a cipher on the lock. Inside was something wrapped in oiled parchment. Sven Thorvalson jumped up from the table and snatched the box from Gorl's hands with uncharacteristic agility.

– Well done, Seeker! As I promised, you can collect your reward. It's in the second drawer of the desk! – shouted the merchant, wholly absorbed in contemplating the box's contents.

Gorl opened the drawer and took out a metal plate with an engraved Fire Symbol pictogram.

No doubt it was one of his people's relics. Touching the plate caused a slight tingling sensation in Gorl's fingers. It indicated that it contained a piece of Mana of their father, the god Mendelef.

Putting the plate in his pocket, Gorl said farewell to Sven Thorvalson and left the merchant's office.
