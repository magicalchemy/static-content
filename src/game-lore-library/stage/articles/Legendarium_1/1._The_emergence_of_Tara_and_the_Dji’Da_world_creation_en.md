# The emergence of Tara and the Dji’Da world creation  
  From the void of Chaos at the beginning of time, Tara came into our reality — higher beings who were the first creatures and the animate embodiment of the Great Energy of the Universe.

Tara were the conductors of Energy and wielded the Flame of Mana, the center of the power of creation in the Universe. There were many of them, and they created matter, space, time, and everything in the cosmos. And they lived that way for myriad years.

But there was no peace in Yueve’s heart, who was the eldest and most powerful Tara. Over countless eras of existence, his taste for life has been lost, and colors became empty. And he realized that life no longer has any meaning: all the mysteries of the cosmos are known to Tara, and all the boundaries are explored and conquered.

Yueve decided to go to the farthest part of the known Universe. Nothing could prevent him from meditating to answer the question: what is their purpose? What do they exist for? And when he found the answer, he returned to his brothers and sisters to share it with them.

They are destined to give life to new creatures with intelligence and will, which will be the true design of Tara’s appearance in the Universe. The word was received enthusiastically, and many decided to follow this path…Many, but not all. Some Tara went beyond the boundaries of the Universe and plunged into deep meditation, searching for what they thought was their true purpose.

All the rest of the older and younger Tara followed Yueve and created Dji’Da, the place that would become home for their children. They made the sky, the earth, the oceans, the stars, the sun, and the moon and called this place their abode. And it was beautiful: green boundless forests stretched across the lands, high mountains touched the sky, and deep seas washed the continents’ shores. Life raged on land, water, and in the sky, and the voices of amazing creatures filled the world. And Tara rejoiced at the fruits of their labor. Each of them found something to give to this world.

Of the many Tara who participated in the Dji’Da creation, seven were the most influential and mighty: Yueve, Gazar, Liere, Mundo, Mendelef, Adomion, and Atanoel. They were brothers and sisters who took the title of gods.

The gods assembled a council and took a long time to decide what their children should be. And they could not come to a consensus. Everyone had their idea of the “ideal” heirs, so the arguments did not cease.

And then Liere, the eldest of the sisters, proposed the following agreement: “Let each of the gods themselves choose and create children to match their own.” And she also offered to cast lots that would determine the creation order of the gods’ heirs.

Tara listened to the words of their wise sister and decided to do as she said.
