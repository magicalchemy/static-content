# Of Magical Creatures. Part III

This information on newfound magical beings is compiled from the few surviving ancient records and supplemented by the research of Vitalius, a member of the Supreme Magical Council of the Academy of Ankorlan, and scholars of the Order of Truth Seekers. The ancient chronicles do not specify for what purposes magical creatures were kept. However, it is undeniable that they were all handheld familiars of the magicians and alchemists of the past.

## Ploplemur

Unfortunately, the original name of the third magical animal I had a chance to study was not preserved in the ancient chronicles, so I took the liberty of giving it the name Ploplemur. These creatures resemble lemurs from a southern island that I had the opportunity to visit on a research expedition. Like lemurs, they can crawl on absolutely any surface. The first part of the name came to my mind because of the highly unusual sounds they make: plop-plop.

Ploplemurs are collective animals. Unlike Magidaks, they can and like to live together in the same enclosure. A group of Ploplemurs has a strict hierarchy. The largest male is always the leader.

The distinctive feature of male Ploplemurs is the thick, dense fur growing around their necks. It reminds me of the jabots of the rich robes of the nobles on the royal council of Erteland. Like the highest dignitaries, male Ploplemurs pompously scuff it up when they sit still.

The magical properties of Ploplemurs, like all other familiars, are fantastic. Ploplemurs can become completely invisible.

You can imagine my surprise when, one morning, I found the cage where the Ploplemurs were kept empty. At first, I thought they had escaped, but all the cage locks were intact. I spent the whole day looking for them until they decided to materialize in front of me. Apparently, it was feeding time, and they showed up so I would remember to feed them.

I attribute the invisibility to the fact that their fur can somehow miraculously generate a magical field that lets sunlight in and doesnâ€™t reflect it out. I wonder, if I sew a cloak from their skins, will it have the invisibility property?

I would very much like to test this hypothesis in practice, but the slanted glances of goblins and sheep bleating outside the window force me to discard such thoughts every time.
