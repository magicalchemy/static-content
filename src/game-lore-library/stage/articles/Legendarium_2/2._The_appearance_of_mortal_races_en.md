## The appearance of mortal races

Atanoel was the first to create children. She represented nature and life itself. Named elves, her children lived in love and harmony with nature and the living creatures inhabiting their evergreen forests.

Elves could see the flows of Mana energy in the world around them, their beauty and grandeur. By learning to control these flows, the children of Atanoel were the first in Dji’Da to master the art of magic.

The second to begin creation was Ghazar, ruler of the earth’s solid rock and keeper of the subsoil. He named his children dwarves after the hammer he had used to cut the first of them out of the rock.

Ghazar gave his children the love and talent to handle riches that he hid in the depths of the mountains and the bowels of the Dji’Da world. And there was no more skillful and sophisticated artisan of stone and metal in the world.

Orcs were the children of Mundo, the God who commands the wind and the storm. They came to the world of Dji’Da after the dwarves. They were mighty, physically strong, and possessed a dashing temper, just like their father, who valued above all the power and might of the primordial elements.

“May strength, fertility, and vitality be a gift for my children, for only those strong in mind and body are worthy of this life,” — Mundo said. And the orcs were firmly following the precepts of their divine father, which would bring a lot of grief to this world in the future.

Yueve was the fourth to create. He decided to endow his children equally with all the same talents that the children of other gods already possessed: to wield magic, like elves; to mine and work with metals, like dwarves; to be steadfast and not to fear the challenges of fate, like orcs.

And the most important thing he gave the people, his children, was the freedom of choice and the will to decide how they should live and serve their God. And while the elves were tied to the forests, the dwarves to the mountains, and the orcs to the desire to stay powerful, all the children of Yueve were deprived of all these bonds.

*The Talent of alchemy, given by Mendelef* 

Goblins were the last to enter the world of Dji’Da. Mendelef, the custodian of all knowledge and lord of alchemy, has long conducted research and experiments with magic and this world’s original elements of matter, resulting in his children being created.

He taught the goblins everything he knew and gave them the great Talent — the art of alchemy. And no one else of the mortal races of the Dji’Da world could possess it.

Liere, the queen of all the waters and seas, did not create her heirs. In return, she shared a piece of her power with each of the divine children. As the master of time, she endowed them with the gift of aging and living only for a certain period set aside by the gods and fate. “When all children are mortal, life will be a hundred times more valuable, and all accomplishments and goals will be brighter and more desirable.” After pondering these words, the gods agreed with Liere’s gift.

The elves were the only ones who did not age and lived longer than all the other races. Atanoel begged in tears to bestow this mercy on her children, for they were the firstborn of this world. Liere and the older brothers could not refuse their beloved younger sister and endowed the elves with longevity and youth.
