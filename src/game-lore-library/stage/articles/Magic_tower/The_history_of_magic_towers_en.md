# The history of Magic Towers

The card game “Magic Towers” is known throughout the world of Dji’Da. Due to its simple rules, it is popular among peasants and nobles alike. The kingdom of Erteland even holds a Towers tournament once a year, and anyone can participate. The main thing is to pay the tournament fee.

The game Magic Towers is over two and a half thousand years old, as the prototype appeared back in the late ninth century in the Empire of Iskander the Mighty. The game is said to reflect the war between the two significant policies of the Empire, Danu and Zana.

The Towers game appeared among the Goblin people in the middle of the twelfth century. It is believed to have been first played by traders from the Lonely Moon tribe and soon spread to all tribes. Over time, Towers became a favorite folk game.

There probably isn’t a goblin who doesn’t know the rules of the game of Towers — so popular it is with the children of Mendelef. Every buhlag and tribe has its champions. The goblins even have a saying: “What is hotter than a fire in a darhan’s furnace? A game of two Magic Towers champions.”

A deck and a sheet of parchment for note-taking are sufficient to play Towers. However, there are sets for the game that are authentic works of magical art. Wooden towers and walls are built by themselves, and beautiful flashes and sounds accompany the movements of the cards.

The only place in the world where such Towers sets are made is the Bizarre Magic Academy, and the price for them can be as high as twenty golden coins. Possessing such a set is considered a luxury among goblins, so many people dream of it.

Finding the ancient homeland of Echoron and uniting the entire nation of Mendelef was not only a momentous occasion for every goblin but also a unique opportunity to have a tournament for the first time in history to see which goblin of which tribe was the most skilled player of Magic Towers.

As the goblins say, this tournament alone was worth the unity of all the tribes. Each goblin considered it a sacred duty to defend the honor of their buhlag and tribe in a game of Magic Towers. Therefore, the competition lasted for two whole weeks due to the sheer number of participants.

Such heated games and passions the world of Dji’Da had never known before. More than a hundred broken noses and knocked-out teeth resulted from discussing and watching the champions’ games. Thanks to Mendelef and the Sentinels, it had never become severe self-mutilation.

The first champion of the Magic Towers was Master Dazar, a darhan of the Zuun Mercat tribe. He had long been known among alchemists and artisans, but after winning the tournament, the entire goblin nation spoke his name with deep respect.
