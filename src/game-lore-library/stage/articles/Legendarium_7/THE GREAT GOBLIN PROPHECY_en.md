# The Great Goblin Prophecy
Since the end of the War with the Mad God and up to the present day, the goblin people have passed down the knowledge of the Great Prophecy. It first appeared in a vision to the High Priestess of the Elves on the night after the final battle with Adomion.

The prophecy said: “The Great Evil shall return to this world, and only the first generation of Mendellef’s children is destined to stop it.”
For long centuries, the goblins kept a careful faith in these words. For hundreds and thousands of years, they lived guided by the prophecy, but time is merciless. It erases cities, and it erases the memory in people’s hearts. Generations came and went, and for many, the prophecy became nothing more than one of the beautiful legends of the Golden Age.

Once, every goblin knew and believed in what had been revealed to the priestess, but now only a few continue to seek its true meaning.
The great alchemists of past ages tried in vain to unravel the prophecy’s secret, to find the key to its fulfillment. They remembered: the first generation of goblins, born by Mendelef himself, had lived at the dawn of the Golden Age. But that age had vanished many thousands of years ago, and no one could understand how, in our time, the children of that first generation could possibly appear.

And yet, for centuries, the goblins continued their search. With special care, they gathered everything that might be connected to the time when the great masters of alchemy lived and created in Dji`Da.

Hundreds of ancient artifacts were collected: scrolls and books in forgotten tongues, magical crystals, and relics whose purpose had long been swallowed by the abyss of time.
But the most mysterious finds were the ancient flasks, each containing a strange, glowing substance. Every flask was unique; no two were ever the same. Neither magic nor brute force could open them, and the nature of their contents remained beyond the understanding of even the wisest alchemists.

One thing, however, was beyond doubt: these flasks were the oldest relics ever discovered. And perhaps they had been created in that very age when the children of Mendelef first appeared.
