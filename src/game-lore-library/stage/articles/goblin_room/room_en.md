# Goblin Chamber 
![](room.2x.png)
*"Dust and cobwebs everywhere. A worn-out straw mattress in the corner, a crooked bookshelf, a broken stool—one of its legs replaced with a rough wooden block. This humble space is meant to be a temporary refuge for a young alchemist…"*

Alchemy is no easy craft. After hours of careful work with ingredients, recipes, and equipment, every alchemist needs a moment to rest before brewing their next potion.
In the Goblin’s Chamber, you can recover your strength, feed your pet, and prepare a fragrant cup of tea over the cauldron. 

While your living space may seem unimpressive at first, over time, you’ll be able to upgrade furniture and decorations, making the room uniquely yours.

Here, you can also check daily quests, the leaderboard, and achievements from the card game. In future updates, you’ll be able to view the world of Djii’Da through a map on the wall and access the Library through a hidden bookshelf passage.

*“The alchemist looked around the room with pride. An antique desk, an armchair of unknown metal that he had found in the ruins of the ancient capital. A bed of the rarest teak wood. The expensive pelt of a northern wolfhound, a gift from a Lonely Moon guardian, lined the stone floor. All of these items he has been collecting for a long time. And now, no one would call this room shabby as it had been the first day Barak opened its doors.”*
