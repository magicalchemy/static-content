# Magic Alchemy Tokenomics

The term tokenomics combines the words “token” and “economics.” It describes all economic aspects related to cryptocurrency tokens, including their creation, distribution, usage, and management.

In this article, we explore the core concepts of tokenomics, its role within the blockchain ecosystem, and examples of successful models.

## What is Tokenomics?
**Tokenomics** encompasses the following key aspects:

- **Token Design:** Defines the purpose and functionality of a token, whether it serves as a payment method, governance tool, or user incentive.
- **Emission Model:** Describes how tokens are created and distributed, including initial allocation parameters and mechanisms for issuing new tokens.
* **Supply and Demand Management:** Considers factors that influence a token’s value, such as maximum supply limits, burning mechanisms, staking, and more.

Tokenomics is a critical component of any successful crypto project. Its design not only determines the project’s appeal to investors but also ensures long-term stability and sustainability.

**To maximize tokenomics stability, the following decisions were implemented:**

* **Finite Gameplay** — The game has a defined endpoint, likely a first in Web3 games.
* **Treasury Vault (Warchest):** A treasury owned by the game to support its economy.

This section presents solutions to these challenges, based on modeling the tokenomics of our game. It takes into account gameplay mechanics and the various influences of user groups that are an integral part of the open economy (industrial farmers, players, and speculators).

## Economy of the Primary Token — POTION
One of the major challenges in crypto game economies is the **sharp decline** in token value, often approaching zero.

Our solution is the **Warchest**, a treasury that collects all game revenues, including **NFT sales, DEX fees**, and **marketplace commissions**.

The Warchest acts as a **market maker**: when **hard floor conditions** are triggered (i.e., the **FDV of POTION** drops below the amount of USDT accumulated in the Warchest), the Warchest buys back POTION, restoring balance.

This mechanism ensures that the **token price cannot fall below its fundamental value**.

Moreover, during gameplay, players often fear large token unlocks, leading them to exit the game prematurely.

The token distribution and lock structure provide players with confidence that there will be no pressure from unlocked tokens during the game.

This issue is addressed by making the game finite, lasting approximately one year. As a result, token unlocks for investors, the team, and community rewards occur after the game ends.

This approach eliminates the fear of token dumps, allowing players to focus entirely on their strategies and progression throughout the game.

The end of the game marks the distribution of community rewards among the winners and the transformation of the Warchest into a DAO fund.

After the game ends, investors, the community, and team members will have a limited window to **exchange POTION for USDT** and exit the DAO if they choose. However, those who decide to stay will have the opportunity to **invest in new projects** from other studios. Most importantly, DAO members will be able to **fund future projects** developed by MA Labs, which will be financed exclusively through the DAO fund.

A significant portion of POTION tokens will remain outside circulation, as they will be actively used by Alchemists for brewing potions in cauldrons (token farming). This process effectively reduces the circulating supply, maintaining a balance between demand and supply and preventing inflation, which is already kept at a low level.

## G.E.M.
![](tokenomics5.2x.png)

While creating the game, we realized it was more than just a game. It’s a **complete economic engine — an infrastructure model** that can be applied to any **Web3 game**.

![](tokenomics6.2x.png)

**Key Components of This Model**:

- **DeFi** — The core, the backbone of the game.
* **Web3 Gameplay** — Mechanics that define the rules (e.g., access to specific pools via NFTs, token burning for progression and development, etc.).
* **Web2 Gameplay** — An off-chain game that ensures a smooth transition for audiences coming from traditional games.

This is how the **Game Economic Model (G.E.M.)** was created. In our studio, we simply call it the **Engine**.

![](tokenomics7.2x.png)

Our economic engine serves as a **framework** for any type of **GameFi project**. You can integrate any **Web2 game** and customize the other components as needed.

We’ve **simplified the game development** process, making it as easy for developers to build a functional product as assembling **LEGO bricks**.

## Fairness, Transparency, and Accessibility
We’ve rejected the **“cookie-cutter”** approach of overvaluing tokens at launch, instead opting for a **long-term strategy** to ensure accessibility for all investors. The project’s initial valuation will be determined directly by players through a **token and NFT auction (public sale)**.

**Dual-Phase Tokenomics Model**

Magic Alchemy’s tokenomics is closely tied to its game design architecture and, like the **G.E.M. engine**, follows an **innovative structure divided into two parts**:

1. **POTION Tokenomics During Gameplay**.
2. **POTION Tokenomics After Gameplay (DAO-based model)**.

**POTION Tokenomics During Gameplay**

MA Labs adheres to the principles of building products for the community and by the community. As shown in the distribution tables, 94% of circulating supply during gameplay is allocated to players.

Investor and team tokens remain locked until the game ends, ensuring fair competition for DeFi players.

Additionally, POTION isn’t just a utility token — it forms the core of the game. As the primary substance for potion brewing (a DeFi mechanic), POTION supports both speculative and fundamental demand.

**Fundamental Demand Drivers for POTION**:
- **Purchasing NFTs** (characters and inventory).
* **Providing liquidity** to core and in-game liquidity pools to farm rewards with high APRs.

**Fundamental Value of POTION**:
* Determined by the **number of tokens needed** for gameplay multiplied by the **number of Alchemists**.
* Influenced by the **number of purchased NFTs**.
* Controlled through **inflation management** within circulating supply.

**Token Supply and Distribution**

Due to strong fundamental demand, POTION may experience a supply shortage during the TGE and early stages of gameplay.

* **Maximum Supply (Max Game Supply): 15 million POTION**.
* **Initial Supply (Initial Supply): 2.255 million POTION (15% of the total supply)**.

The timeline of POTION’s circulating supply growth during the game is shown below:

![](tokenomics9.2x.png)

Since Magic Alchemy has a **finite gameplay duration**, the project will continue evolving and **transition into a DAO** after the game ends. At this stage, the game tokenomics shifts to a DAO-based model, featuring a Total Supply of **100 million POTION**.

Of this supply, **50 million POTION** (exactly 50%) will be distributed as **rewards** for in-game achievements.

![](tokenomics10.2x.png)

A key element of the DAO tokenomics is the SAFU Fund (Warchest), which accumulates all profits from NFT sales, pool fees, and marketplace commissions. The Warchest serves as a value support mechanism for rewards earned by Alchemists and acts as a backing reserve for the POTION token in the DAO phase.

This ensures that POTION’s price is protected from falling to zero. The Warchest is filled with stable currency (USDT) and revenue from card game fees based on RUSK tokens.

## Transition to DAO
At the end of the game, the liquidity provided by the Warchest is withdrawn from liquidity pools, and for a limited time (up to 2 weeks), POTION holders can redeem their tokens for assets in the Warchest, proportional to their holdings.

Alternatively, holders can choose to:

1. **Fully exchange their POTION for USDT** based on the Warchest formula:

**USDT in Warchest / Circulating POTION**

1. **Partially exchange** POTION for USDT and retain a portion in the DAO.
2. **Keep all POTION in the DAO** and become full members of MA Labs DAO.

**Benefits of DAO Membership**

* Priority investment opportunities in future projects developed by MA Labs and other studios.
* Access to exclusive funding rounds at preferential terms.
* The ability to influence project development and governance decisions.

*Instead of dumping tokens into the market, the Warchest enables direct swaps through smart contracts, ensuring fairness and stability for all participants.*

**Example**:

A player named Onotole has **1,000 POTION** and earns an additional **10,000 POTION** locked until the end of the game. At the conclusion, Onotole can:

* Fully exchange **11,000 POTION for USDT** at the Warchest rate.
* Partially exchange POTION for USDT and retain the rest in the DAO.
* Keep the full amount in the DAO and continue participating in its growth and future funding initiatives.
