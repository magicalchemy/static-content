# Lilith’s Story
## Part I. Childhood

![](lilit_1.2x.jpg)


Lilith didn’t know her parents. She was left as an infant at the gates of the monastery of St. Onydia, near the capital of the Theocracy of Leria, the city of Belstal. Lilith, like many other abandoned children, became a pupil of the orphanage at the monastery.

From childhood, Lilith had to face ridicule and bullying from other children because she was a half-elf, but because of her strong character and fearlessness, she proved that she could stand up for herself. Like a wildcat, she lunged at anyone who hurt her, and soon, all those who bullied her realized it was best not to mess with her.

Despite her tough temper, Lilith was very kind to the younger children, always cared for them, and helped them as much as possible. For this, she was beloved by the sister nuns, and one old mentor particularly noted her in all her dealings. She told Lilith that when she was left at the monastery gates, she had a golden pendant and a letter asking to take care of the baby. And the prioress of the monastery took the pendant for herself at once. Most likely, it is kept together with other valuables in a chest in her private office.

Lilith’s main goal was to get the pendant as her parents’ only testimony and memory. She waited for the right moment to steal it. And now is the moment. In a week, the Bishop of Mitria is due to arrive at their monastery, and Mother Superior has been spending more time away these past few days dealing with the arrangements for the Bishop’s meeting and reception.

## Part II. Adolescence

Lilith was able to carry out her plan. She broke into the Mother Superior’s study and stole her parents’ pendant from the chest, a small gold medallion with a milk-colored stone in the middle with a heron carved. The work on the stone was so beautifully and skillfully done that if you looked closely, you could see the heron’s feathers.

As Lilith would learn much later, the pendant had been made by master jewelers from the Dudzhun Empire and had cost a lot of money. The people who had left her at the monastery’s gates were probably rich.

Lilith realized she could not stay in the monastery after what she did. That same day, she left the walls of this place, which had been her home for ten years, and went into the unknown.

Lilith wandered the streets of Belstal for a long time, and life there proved to be harsh. Lilith had to fight for food and shelter every day. She learned to use all her skills and knack to survive. Over time, Lilith joined a gang of beggars who lived on the streets, begging for alms from passersby and engaging in petty theft.

One day, Lilith decided to steal a purse from an older man walking down the street without a care. She guessed when the older man would turn away and quickly pull the strap of the purse, but at the exact moment, she felt an iron grip on her hand. It turned out that the older man was quick and attentive despite his age. He looked at Lilith seriously.

*“Did you think you could do it?” — The old man said without taking his eyes off the girl. “You know, I could call the guards and send you to prison, but I will give you another chance.”*

 ## Part III. Youth

  The old man’s name was Clatius. He told Lilith that in his youth he had been a soldier in the White Legion and had fought in many wars and campaigns in the name of the faith and the Holy Throne. He had served honorably and faithfully for twenty years in the Legion and had risen to the rank of tenth officer before retiring.

He returned to his village and started a family. He would have lived in peace, but apparently the Sun God had other plans. One year his wife and two sons died of cholera, which was rampant in those parts. After burying his family, Clatius moved to the capital to live out his life.

He lived on the pension paid to all veterans who had served the Holy Throne for a full twenty years. And though the money was not much, it was enough for him, an old man, and one more mouth would not weigh down his purse.

Lilith believed Clatius and agreed to follow him. So she found the home and family she had dreamed of in the orphanage. Clatius became a good mentor and father to her.

He taught her everything he knew himself. Seeing that Lilith had the physical agility of her elven blood, he taught her to wield a bow and a short sword. Knowing the combative temperament and sharp tongue his ward possessed, he also taught her how to fend for herself in a fist fight. Perhaps he did this in memory of his sons.

After a while, Lilith showed Clatius the pendant that she had been cherishing all this time. He told her that it was precious, and if she wanted to know more about it, she should go to the Dudzhun Empire. The milk jade that adorned the pendant was only mined there.

They lived happily for several years, until one day the Sun God took Clatius to himself. After burying her father, Lilith didn’t want to stay in Belstal.

Many things happened to Lilith in the future, until fate brought her to the Echoron Valley, where she now works as a waitress in the Fallen Moon Tavern.
