# Bagbir’s Story. 
## Part I. Heir to the family business

![](bagbir1.2x.png)

Bagbir was born into a family of hereditary brewers. The Bushybeard clan is one of the six that formed the kingdom of Hada-Nor in the mountains of Coldania at the dawn of a new age in dark times.

Ever since they were children, Bagbir and his three younger brothers helped their elders in the large family brewery, which was located in the western quarter of the capital city of Cormard. Like all his brothers, he was raised to love the clan craft and honor the ancient and respected art of brewing for every dwarf.

According to dwarven tradition, Bagbir was to have the family brewery as the eldest in the family. But the older Bagbir got, the more he grew weary of the thought.

One day, as a young dwarf, he left the underground kingdom of Hada-Nor with his uncle and a few other relatives on a trade mission for the Iron Throne. The dwarves were on their way to Minas, the capital of the kingdom of Erteland, for the annual exchange of goods with humans.

Bagbir saw the world outside of the dwarves’ underground kingdom for the first time. Thousands of new smells, colors, and sounds shook the young dwarf to the core, and the beautiful dawn seen for the first time in the background of coastal Minas was forever imprinted in his memory.

From then on, he greatly desired to learn as much as possible about the outside world. He had a crazy idea to leave his home and start traveling in the world that was on the surface.

## Part II. The outside world

Bagbir decided the easiest way to see the world on the surface again was to take a job with the trade guild. He gave up his inheritance of the family brewery and devoted his life entirely to fulfilling his dream.

He worked as a clerk in a trade guild for several years until he earned the right to become a full member. And now, at last, he had a chance to see the world outside the underground kingdom again.

The guild had organized a trade mission to the kingdom of Erteland. Bagbir, a young but well-established member of the guild, was included in the mission. The dwarf managed to negotiate with the mission head to stay for a year in the guild office, which was located in the Old Quarter of Minas, the capital of Erteland.

All that year, he had been studying the history and mores of the people around him. Bagbir was impressed by how immense and limitless the world on the surface was. The thought of going back drove him to despair. Eventually, the dwarf decided to leave Minas and travel the world. He said goodbye to the other dwarves who worked in the representative office and asked them to send a letter to his family explaining his decision.

For several years, he traveled all over the continent of Khela. The dwarf ventured for the magical forests of Mithremar, the hot sands of Eastern Balkh, and the great plains of the Dudzhun Empire. However, wherever Bagbir traveled, he was interested in recipes and methods of making hop drinks.

## Part III. Life among humans

Traveling through Khela, Bagbir visited every possible kingdom and country. He dreamed of going to the eastern continent of Farnax, but he could not get there. The reason was that the sight of the boundless expanse of the sea inspired great awe and fear in the true representative of the dwarven people born in the depths of the mountains. The mere thought of sailing on a ship in the middle of the sea for weeks made Bagbir sick.

The only way to get to Farnax was to use magical portals. However, only some of the most powerful mages in the world could open them. So, the dream of traveling to Farnax had to be abandoned.

Bagbir settled in the southern province of Bangoa in the Dudzhun Empire. The mild climate and scenic vistas there had been a particular favorite of the dwarf during his past travels. It was in the town of Puncha that he opened his tavern. There, he met his love, a Lingmei woman, who became his wife.

Bagbir lived a long fifty years with his beloved Mu Lin. They were the happiest years of his life, but unfortunately, the human age is much shorter than the dwarf age. After Mu Ling’s funeral, nothing kept him in these lands. On the contrary, everything around him only reminded him of their happy life together. So, after a short thought, Bagbir decided to set out on the road again.

He planned to return to Hada-Nor, visit his family, and share with them all the new hop recipes he had learned after living so many years among humans. Bagbir was even contemplating staying in the dwarven kingdom forever when suddenly, halfway to the mountains of Coldania, he learned that in the Castle Mountains, the goblins had found their homeland of legends and that this land hid hundreds and hundreds of secrets and curiosities.

Bagbir could not pass by such a thing, so he steered the wagon with all his belongings toward the Castle Mountains.
