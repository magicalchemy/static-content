The Goblin Bank was established by the Goblin Trade Guild, headquartered in the kingdom of Ankorlan, though its reputation extends far beyond its borders.

From a gameplay perspective, the Goblin Bank serves as the primary Liquidity Pool.
If you’re not interested in actively playing, you can provide liquidity to the Goblin Bank and earn passive income. 

External liquidity can be deposited in two ways:
- Automatically
- Manually
