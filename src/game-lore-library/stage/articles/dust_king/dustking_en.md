# PvE Event: “The Dusty King”
![](images/kingEN.2x.png)

*“Dark times are coming. The mad god Adomion, enemy of all living things, seeks once again to return to this world. His servants, those who survived have been hiding for millennia in the most distant and shadowed corners of Dji’Da, ever since their master fell into slumber under the power of the Divine Elixir. But his strength is awakening, and his followers have already emerged from their hiding places. For now, they are but formless wraiths, yet they already hunt mortals, stealing their souls to regain their power.*

*One of their vessels became the Dust King. His greed made him an easy prey. Madness took hold of him the King attacked everyone nearby, muttering strange words. At first, everyone thought he had simply overused magic dust, but soon it became clear: darkness had taken root within him. And only a sacred goblin ritual can drive it out.*

*The goblins know the ancient way of exorcism. Their weapons may seem absurd – slimy boogers, bream fish, and smelly rags yet only they can subdue the evil spirit and purify the King’s heart. When the Dust King regains his senses, he will, in gratitude, open his Chest and every hero will receive a generous reward for taking part in his salvation…”*
– “Chronicles of Echoron” by Gorl Da’Narga.

Greetings, Seekers of Truth and Alchemists, children of Mendelef’s kin!

We are introducing a new activity for you a cooperative competitive PvE event. event. The entire Magic Alchemy community must unite to help the Dusty King by performing the ancient goblin ritual of exorcism to drive out the evil spirit that has taken over his body.

## Mechanics

All players will have to work together to perform the ritual of banishing the demon from the Dust King so that he can regain control of himself. To do this, you’ll need to find him on the second floor of the “Fallen Moon” tavern and engage in battle with the evil spirit.

The Dusty King has a shared HP bar for all participants, and every player’s damage will be counted. That’s why we call this event cooperative yet competitive PvE.

You’ll have to strike him using special exorcism tools: boogers, bream fish, and smelly rags.
These are ancient and time-tested goblin remedies, proven effective over centuries of use!

All these items can be purchased with USDT. Each use grants instant rewards **a guaranteed ticket to the Grand Raffle**, as well as Croutons dropped randomly per hit.

Additionally, you can purchase a damage boost for **10,000 $RUSK**, active for **24 hours**, providing **+20% extra damage**. 

For example, a player activates a damage boost. If they deal 8,500 damage, the boost adds an additional 1,700 damage. As a result, the total damage equals 10,200. Thus, with the boost, the player can earn more rewards while actually dealing less damage.

## Daily Damage Meter & Mystery Boxes
