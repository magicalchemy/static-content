However, the full-release version of the game will offer even more. Every NPC in the tavern will serve as a source of daily and basic quests related to alchemy, potion crafting, and ingredient gathering.

Even Dust King will finally drop his usual sarcasm and start handing out quests—giving players. You'll find out which ones at the release. 

*“Wherever three or more gather, a dwarf will open a tavern.”*
— Ancient dwarven wisdom.

And so, when Echoron Valley was discovered, it was only a matter of time before the enterprising dwarves of Koldania got involved. Within mere months, the very first—and soon the most famous—tavern in the valley opened its doors: Fallen Moon.
