# Magic Alchemy Combat System

## Core Principles

The Magic Alchemy combat system is based on a combination of traditional combat skills and the use of magical abilities. Combat represents a strategic interaction between physical attacks, defensive maneuvers, and the application of alchemical and magical effects.

## Combat Components

### Physical Attacks

Include the use of:
- Melee weapons (swords, axes, spears)
- Ranged weapons (bows, crossbows, throwing weapons)
- Unarmed techniques (strikes, grabs, evasions)

The effectiveness of physical attacks depends on:
- Character attributes (strength, dexterity, endurance)
- Weapon mastery
- Quality and characteristics of the weapon used
- Opponent's armor type

### Alchemical Components

Unlike direct magic, alchemy requires preparation and use of:
- Potions and elixirs (healing, attribute enhancement, effect application)
- Bombs and explosive mixtures (area damage, elemental damage)
- Traps and defensive mechanisms (battlefield control)
- Transmutation compounds (changing environment and materials)

### Magical Abilities

Although direct magic has become rarer after the Great Rift, some characters can use:
- Elemental spells (fire, water, earth, air)
- Support spells (ally enhancement, healing)
- Control magic (slowing, stunning, immobilization)
- Summoning entities and familiars

## Combat Stances and Tactics

### Offensive Stance
- Increases damage dealt
- Reduces defense
- Allows special offensive techniques

### Defensive Stance
- Reduces damage taken
- Increases chance to block attacks
- Allows counterattacks

### Alchemical Stance
- Accelerates preparation of alchemical compounds
- Increases effectiveness of potions and elixirs
- Reduces the cost of using alchemical items

## Damage and Protection System

Damage in Magic Alchemy is divided into several types:
- **Physical** (slashing, piercing, bludgeoning)
- **Elemental** (fire, ice, lightning, acid)
- **Magical** (pure energy, necrotic, astral)
- **Mental** (fear, illusions, mind control)

Protection is also divided into categories corresponding to damage types and depends on:
- Worn armor and its properties
- Magical effects and potions
- Character's innate resistances
- Active defensive skills

## Combo System

A special mechanic of Magic Alchemy is the combination system, allowing to combine:
- Different types of attacks in one sequence
- Physical attacks with alchemical effects
- Joint actions of several characters

### Combination example:
1. Applying alchemical oil to a weapon
2. Performing a series of quick strikes
3. Activating the oil with a magical pulse
4. Dealing explosive area damage
