# The Owner of the “White Unicorn”

The midday heat filled the streets of Greer with a sweltering veil. The capital of the Grand Duchy of Rado has always suffered from the heat at this time of year. Even the afternoon breeze could not dispel this stuffiness.

Gorl, wiping sweat from his forehead, tried to make his way through the crowd filling the market square. He needed to find an elderly goblin. Gorl believed that only he could know anything about the artifacts found.

The Fire and Air Symbol plates, obtained by Gorl about ten years ago, kept him busy. He had found several similar artifacts, but they were all damaged or broken after all these years. 

Although the plates were made of metal, they became brittle over time. The goblin alchemists suggested that most plates had lost their magical powers. Only the two that Gorl extracted retained the energy of the original Mendelef's Mana.

Gorl spent a lot of time in libraries looking for information and discovered that the latest records on plate research belonged to a goblin named Cord, one of the Seekers. 

Gorl wanted to meet him and discuss his research, but Kord had already left the Order fifteen years ago. He decided to retire, even though he had been offered a high position in the Order. 

Kord settled in Greer, a city where goods and curiosities flocked from all over the world. He opened a small shop selling antiquities. Gorl was looking for it in the shopping quarter. 

After two days of searching, Gorl was finally at the doorstep of the White Unicorn shop. Once inside, Gorl had no time to look around before he was called out from the back of the hall.

– Greetings, Seeker. What did the Order want with an old goblin? – said the elderly goblin behind the counter.

– Hello, dear Kord. My name is Gorl. You are the only one who can help me. What can you tell me about it?  – asked Gorl, pulling out and showing the parchment showing the plates.

– Curious stuff, but your drawing is inaccurate. All the plates we have ever found have been broken or damaged; you have them pictured here intact. Or are you telling me that two whole ones have been found?

– Yes, I personally obtained two plates with elemental symbols.

– Excellent. I knew there must still be some undamaged ones in the world, but I'd rather talk about that in my private office. I've just got a bottle of dwarven ale from Duke Rado's supply. It will make the conversation much livelier. 

Making himself comfortable in his study, Kord told him everything he had learned about the plates. He assumed they were not simple plates with the runes of the elements but magic keys. But Kord was never able to find out exactly what they were opening. 

– I have spent a lifetime researching and searching for these artifacts and have already lost hope that I will ever be able to find them. So I decided to retire and leave it to young goblins like you.   

I got my hands on a whole plate of the Water Rune a couple of years ago. Yes, I know I should have handed it over to the Order immediately, but I decided to keep it. Think of it as a senile bliss and a pleasant reminder of the glorious deeds of youth. I couldn't deny myself the pleasure of possessing her. 

Now, I see that you have made significant progress in your search and are willing to give it up, but there is one condition. You have to answer all my questions correctly. It's a test to see if you're worthy of owning an artifact. 

For several hours, Kord bombarded Gorl with questions on all academic subjects, rules, and regulations that members of the Order of the Seekers of Truth were expected to know. Sweat appeared on Gorl’s forehead. He had never struggled this much, not even during the final exam when he answered the questions of the Order’s High Council. He was beginning to think that these questions would never end. When suddenly, their flow abruptly stopped.

– Well done, Seeker! You are worthy of this award. I believe with all my heart that you will be able to find all the plates and discover the secret they are hiding. 

Gorl took a metal plate with the Water Element Symbol in it. As on previous occasions, he felt a slight tingling in his fingers when he touched it.

The morning sun was already showing on the watchtowers of Greer when Gorl left the White Unicorn. Admiring the dawn of a new day, Gorl was firmly convinced that he was one step closer to his goal.
