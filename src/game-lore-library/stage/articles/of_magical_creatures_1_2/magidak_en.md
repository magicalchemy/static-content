# Of Magical Creatures. Part I  
  This information on newfound magical beings is compiled from the few surviving ancient records and supplemented by the research of Vitalius, a member of the Supreme Magical Council of the Academy of Ankorlan, and scholars of the Order of Truth Seekers. The ancient chronicles do not specify for what purposes magical creatures were kept. However, it is undeniable that they were all handheld familiars of the magicians and alchemists of the past.

## Magidak

This fantastic animal lived in the forests of a now-extinct island in the southern part of the Sea of Oblivion. It is not known whether it was a bird or a mammal. Some are inclined to believe that magidaks result from the experiments of the great alchemists of the past.

Magidaks possess a peculiar affinity for precious metals and stones, a trait that has sparked much intrigue. Ancient scrolls depict these creatures in tandem with dwarves, toiling in the depths of mines. Upon discovering jewels, Magidaks instinctively seek to conceal them within their dwellings. So, should your silverware or family heirlooms inexplicably vanish, you now have a clue as to their whereabouts.

Magidaks have a curious nature. They are just like children — they like to stick their beaks where it doesn’t belong and adore water. The future owner should equip the house where they plan to keep the Magidak with an outdoor pool. At the worst, a large bathtub will do. The only thing is that, most likely, you yourself will have to find a new place to wash. There are several reasons for this, listed below.

The Magidak prefers to live alone. Attempts to keep several individuals together resulted in constant fights. It fiercely defends the territory it considers its own. Its cute appearance and peaceful demeanor should not mislead you. It would be best to be extremely careful when handling the Magidak, as the tiny claws on its cute paws contain deadly poison.

The venerable goblin alchemists struggled to find an antidote to Magidak’s poison. Unfortunately, several goblin who volunteered to serve the great art of alchemy died in the process.

Even I, the Legendary Vitalius, fell victim to the creature’s charms. Because of my carelessness, I had to lie in bed for days with a high fever from a cut left by its claws.

After this incident, I had to be more careful with my protective gear and ensure my body was completely covered when I visited the enclosure. Alas, as much as I would like to pat Magidak’s amazingly silky fur, I now do so only with protective gloves.
