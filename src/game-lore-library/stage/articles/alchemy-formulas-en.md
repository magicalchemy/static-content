# Alchemy Formulas and Recipes

## Basics of Alchemy

Alchemy in the Magic Alchemy world is an ancient art of matter transformation using special techniques and ingredients. After the Great Rift, when direct magic became less accessible, alchemy gained special significance as an alternative source of magical effects.

## Alchemical Components

### Ingredients Classification

All alchemical ingredients are divided into several basic categories:

1. **Plant-based** — herbs, roots, leaves, flowers, tree bark
2. **Mineral** — crystals, metals, mineral salts, precious stones
3. **Animal-derived** — animal parts, secretions, poisons
4. **Ethereal** — concentrated magical energy in various forms
5. **Catalysts** — special components enhancing the effect of other ingredients

### Ingredient Rarity

- **Common** — available in most alchemical shops
- **Rare** — require special search or order from traders
- **Very rare** — obtained only in certain locations or under special conditions
- **Unique** — exist in single specimens or require special conditions for creation

## Basic Alchemical Processes

### Extraction

The process of extracting active substances from ingredients using solvents (water, alcohol, ether).

```
Procedure:
1. Grind the source material
2. Add solvent
3. Heat to optimal temperature
4. Maintain for the required time
5. Filter the resulting liquid
```

### Distillation

Separating mixtures into components through evaporation and condensation.

```
Procedure:
1. Place the mixture in a distillation vessel
2. Heat to boiling temperature
3. Collect the condensate
4. If necessary, repeat the process to increase purity
```

### Transmutation

Transforming one substance into another using alchemical catalysts.

```
Procedure:
1. Prepare the source material
2. Add catalyst
3. Activate the process using ethereal energy
4. Control the reaction until completion
```

| ♂ | Iron/Mars |
| ♀ | Copper/Venus |
| ☿ | Mercury |
| ♄ | Lead/Saturn |

### Formula Notation Example

```
☉+3☿+♄→♃(☽)
```

*Decoding: Mix gold with triple portion of mercury and lead to obtain tin with silver properties*

## Alchemical Equipment

- **Athanor** — special furnace for alchemical processes
