# Glob’s Story

![](Glob.2x.jpg)

Glob is a goblin of the Alchemist buhlag who has devoted his life to studying astrology’s mystical, magical art. Ancient magicians and scientists have long suggested a direct connection between the movement of the celestial bodies and many of the events of the world of Dji’Da.

Based on ancient magical writings and observations, Glob derived what he claimed was a universal magic formula that used the position of the stars in the sky to predict the future. Glob decided that if only he had access to this knowledge, he could get rich, so he opened a shop selling predictions and forecasts near the Fallen Moon Tavern.

Now, everyone could discover their fate, but somehow, the queue of those wishing to use Glob’s services did not appear either on the first day of opening or a month later. The rare customers who visited his shop were young couples. They were all interested in how many children they would have and when they should get married — that sort of questions.

Glob could not understand why he should predict such insignificant things. Where are the greats of this world, asking how their next military campaign will end? Where are the famous trading magnates asking to see what the price of wool or grain will be in a year? Where are all these people?

It was with such worries and thoughts that Glob, in a twist that surprised even himself, began to frequent the Fallen Moon Tavern. Instead of seeking answers from the stars, he seemed to have decided to look for them at the bottom of his mug.
