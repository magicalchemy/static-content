# Paid games on $RUSK

![](12.2x.jpg)

Hey everyone! The wait is over—we’ve officially launched paid games. And not just for money, but for rusks! Yes, now you can visit the Fallen Moon Tavern, grab a hearty stout from Bagbir, and challenge your opponent for $RUSK, our already legendary meme token.

It's important to mention that those who registered via Telegram can easily transfer their rusks to other wallets. If you want to move your $RUSK or sell them, you’ll be able to do so without any hassle.

❗️ If you’re having trouble topping up your in-game balance, follow these steps:

1. In the Lobby, click the plus sign to top up your balance.
2. Sign the transaction, then head to Transaction History to check that the funds were added.
3. The funds will appear in your in-game balance when you re-enter the game after topping up.
4. If they don’t, click the plus sign again and visit Transaction History.
5. After opening the transaction history window, your balance should update.

*Note: You may need to wait a minute at this step for the transaction confirmation to come through.

Fellow alchemists, play, win rusks, and have a blast.
