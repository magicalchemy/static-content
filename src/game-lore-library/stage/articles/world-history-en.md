# Magic Alchemy World History

## Origin of the Universe

In the beginning, there was only the Void — an infinite space of possibilities. Then came the event known as the Great Awakening. Ancient powers, known as the Primordials, created the world from chaos and filled it with magical energy called Aether.

## First Era: The Genesis

The First Era, lasting a millennium, was a time of incredible wonders. Continents were formed, the first races took their initial steps on land, and magic flowed freely throughout the world. During this era, the first great city-states emerged.

### Key Events

- **Founding of Arcania** — the first city of mages in year 0 of the Arcadian Calendar
- **Treaty of Seven Towers** — formation of the first magical council in the year 347
- **Appearance of Dimensional Gates** — discovery of pathways to parallel worlds in the year 892

## Second Era: Rise and Fall

The Second Era was marked by the flourishing of civilization, the development of technologies, and magical arts. However, the ambitions of great mages led to a catastrophe known as the Great Rift.

### The Great Rift

In the year 1563, the mage Asterius, in an attempt to achieve immortality, tore the fabric of reality, leading to a massive catastrophe. Entire cities were destroyed, and the balance of magic was disrupted. The consequences of this event are still felt in the world today.

## Modern Era

Currently, the world is recovering from the upheavals of the past. New states have emerged on the ruins of old ones, and magic has become a rarer and more valuable resource. Alchemy is experiencing a revival as a way to compensate for the weakening of direct magic.
