# History of the alchemical elements. Part 2

![](3Mendelef.2x.jpg)

### Sanctum — the element of soul and inner strength.
Ancient dwarven lore says that during the Wars of the Survivors, one of the dwarven clans took refuge in the cave of the Iron Mountains to escape an army of maddened Children of Mundo. The cave’s vaults were so small that the massive orcs could not get in. When the dwarves traveled deep into the cave, it appeared open to the sky. Millions of stars reflected in the eyes of the survivors, who took it as a favor from the gods.

The surviving dwarves called the place holy. Later, crystals were found in the cave, which had the unusual property of giving inner peace and strength to all nearby.

### Perumnik — the element of transformation and change.
Forest goblins have always been amazed by the great diversity of plant life in the Elven Kingdom of Adriennel. Many species of plants grew only here, under the canopy of ancient and majestic forests.

Fueled by their unquenchable thirst for knowledge, the alchemists of the forest goblins embarked on a quest to unravel the mystery behind this natural wonder. Their relentless pursuit led them to the discovery of Perumnik–the pollen from the flowers of a creeping liana that permeated the entire forest, triggering rapid growth and transformation in any plant it touched.

The mages from the Bizaria Science Council, who had managed to familiarise themselves with the Forest Goblins’ records, would call this phenomenon accelerated transmutation caused by a superactive mutagen.

### Chronos — the element of time and its variability.
In the ballads that minstrels love to sing, there is one that tells a beautiful and tragic love story. In ancient times, when the first kingdoms of men first appeared in the world of Dji’Da, the elf Zeldor fell in love with a princess of the people of men. Their love was beautiful and bright, but the lives of mortals were short by the standards of the elves. And so Zeldor set out to find the source of eternal life for his beloved.

Years passed. When Zeldor returned to his beloved with the artifact that grants long life, the bitter truth awaited him. His beloved had already turned into an ancient old woman and was lying on her deathbed. Zeldor realized his mistake — they could have enjoyed life together, even if it was short.

Instead, he had left her, and their time had been lost forever. Realizing all this, Zeldor stabbed his own heart with a dagger along with his beloved’s last breath. Droplets of blood from the wound spilled onto the ground and became jewels. They were named Chronos in honor of Zeldor’s beloved, thus immortalizing her and the memory of their love.

### Abercromite — the element of shadows and secrecy.
Found in the deepest mines of Bayan’Gol, Abercromite is a rare and unusual black mineral. Its scarcity is such that a small piece of Abercromite is ten times more valuable than a diamond of the same size. However, its rarity is not the only factor contributing to its value. When exposed to direct sunlight, Abercromite begins to deteriorate and eventually evaporates in just a few minutes. The dwarves, who call it Zuham Haranhy, which translates to ‘part’ or ‘piece’ of darkness, are the only ones who have managed to mine this precious mineral.

Its principal value to mages and wizards is its unique properties. A mage in possession of Abercromite can surpass their limits in the amount of Mana available to them. The larger the stone, the greater the Mana available to the mage.

### Draconite — the element that embodies power and majesty.
Draconite is a joint discovery of goblin alchemists and human scientists. It is a soft metal found in the lava of a volcano. The people who inhabit the northern lands of Dornkun, where this metal was first discovered, have a belief that volcanoes are the graves of the Dracs, the fiery giants who served the Great Tara in the days when the first mortals were beginning to settle this world. Therefore, honoring the folk epic, the researchers decided to give this element such a name.

### Jordanius — the element of luck and chance.
The architecture of Venturia impresses any traveler with its beauty: the white towers and spires remain in the memory for a long time, leaving you in awe of their majesty and beauty. At the heart of this splendor is Jordanius, a durable mineral with a milky white color. It is widely used in construction because it is stronger and lighter than marble.

The only known deposits of Jordanius are located in the western province of Felicia, making them a rare and valuable find. Discovered about four hundred years ago, these deposits have a rich history. The chronicles tell the story of the patriarch of the Great House, who owned this province and was in dire financial straits. His search for gold deposits on his lands led to the discovery of this unique mineral.

He spent almost the last of his money on this search and soon could have gone bankrupt, but one day, he accidentally discovered deposits of a new mineral on his lands. At first, he did not pay much attention to this event. Still, when the word about the new mineral and its excellent decorative properties spread widely, the aristocrat realized that this mineral could become a source of excellent income.

Thanks to this accidental but extremely successful discovery, his noble family became fabulously rich.

### Rowl — the element reflects the beauty and energy of the aurora borealis.
The bleak and harsh lands of the wild and ferocious Northern Horde are the only places where the alchemical element Rowl has been discovered. It is found only in valleys where geysers of foul-smelling, scalding hot water spurt from the ground. Rowl in the form of tiny crystals is formed along the edge of the reservoirs where the water from the geysers flows down.

The few brave men who venture this far into the Orc lands say that a spectacle of fantastic beauty is revealed at night when the northern lights are incredibly bright in the sky. The area where the geysers flow begins to glow with bright colors, and it is unclear where the colors are brighter–in the sky or on the ground.

### Astralon — the element symbolizes a connection to the astral world.
A forest goblin master alchemist named Gluck had been searching for rare elements to create the elixir of Life Extension for many years. He explored the forests of Adriennel, and when every corner of the land of the elves was known to him, he decided that once he had learned everything down below, it was time to go upstairs. In the crowns of the centuries-old trees that littered the sky, the goblin Gluck discovered new and hitherto unseen mushrooms. After studying them, he found a new element, Astralon.

It did not prolong his life, but it bestowed upon him the ability to transcend his physical form and enter the astral realm. In this ethereal state, he could soar like a bird, witnessing countless marvels that filled his heart with wonder. He flew into the clouds, towards the dawn, and it was then that Gluck realized that life’s true essence lay in such fleeting moments of beauty.

### Nimbus — the element that embodies the obscurity and mysticism of the heavens.
Not long ago, the goblins found their lost homeland–the hidden valley of Echoron. The way to it was discovered among the hundreds of confusing and dangerous caves of the Castle Mountains. In addition, in the twisting caves and bottomless chasms, a gas was also found that caused thick fog in the area.

The alchemical element Nimbus in this gas has become widely used in alchemy to create elixirs related to atmospheric phenomena. Sailors use it to avoid storms; in the capitals, it establishes good weather during grand festivities. Small towns near capitals don’t like this, as clouds dispersed over the central city rain down on neighboring territories.

### Tolkinite — symbolizes rebirth and immortality.
Heisen, an alchemist from the Vala’as Hina tribe known for his medical research, tried to create an elixir that could cure all diseases. He conducted hundreds of thousands of alchemical experiments and wasted hundreds of rare and unique minerals and plants, but all to no avail.

When despair almost overcame the alchemist, and Heisen was ready to relinquish his quest, he suddenly noticed one of the many flasks on his laboratory’s shelves and tables. It was the only flask that did not contain the rotten mold that had adorned all the other vessels that Hazen had not had time to clean from the traces of his failed experiments.

Realizing that this case was unusual, the alchemist began to examine the substance that had formed in the flask. This is how Tolkinite was discovered — an alchemical element that saved many lives.

### Ethereum — the element representing celestial or etheric forces.
Ethereum was discovered by the mad scientist Vitalius, a regular at the Fallen Moon tavern. In what he claimed was another stunning and breakthrough experiment, Vitalius sought a way to contact a parallel projection of our world.

He claimed that mortals like those in Dji’Da inhabited it but that it was a world without magic or sorcery. Everyone knows that magic is the essence and root of the universe, originating from the Flame of Mana, the energy of the universe shared with mortals by the ancient Tara.

It was a vision that came to Vitalius after he had consumed a century’s worth of fire brandy from the best brewers in the Iron Throne. Despite the laughter and disbelief of those around him, the scientist-mage was resolute in his quest to prove the existence of this parallel projection.

From his scientific experiment, Vitalius birthed a new element, Ethereum. He confessed that the name had come to him in a dream of this new world. This element, he believed, held the key to connecting the two worlds, but the exact method eluded him. He pledged to continue his experiments, determined to unravel the mysteries of Ethereum.

### Malabs — the element that represents the universal force of creation, development and birth.
The Malabs, a small magical community, brought together prominent scholars and mages from around the Dji’Da world. Despite being from different nations, they were united by their love for the scientific approach to studying magic and the search for new knowledge. One day, after a conference, they decided to meet in a pub for a bottle of strong ale.

One of the scientists, his eyes shining with excitement, shared about the new method he was developing to create alchemical elements. The room buzzed with anticipation as everyone began to make different guesses and assumptions about this groundbreaking method. The decision was unanimous-they would continue their discussions in his laboratory. All night long, fueled by dwarven ale, they delved into radical and daring experiments. And finally, their efforts bore fruit-a new alchemical element, the Malabs, was born.

Malabs and the method of its creation were breakthroughs in the magical world, but members of the community deny any involvement in the discovery. To all questions, they respond by laughing: “If you want to give someone the Nobelkus Prize, the creator of dwarven ale is most deserving of it.”
