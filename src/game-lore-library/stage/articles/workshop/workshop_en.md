# Workshop
![](workshop.2x.png)

*"In the center of the room, a potion was simmering over a low flame in a large bronze cauldron. The Forest Goblin alchemist watched the fire closely and stirred the potion strictly clockwise at certain times. And, Tara forbid, he stirs it counterclockwise. Then a week's work would be wasted."*

The workshop is the main game location for your Alchemist. Here, he will brew the main pool of game tokens: Vala, Miata, etc. The player will need to stake the Alchemist's NFT so that he can pour his game tokens into the main pool and “start brewing potions.”
