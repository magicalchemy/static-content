# The Northern Lands
Gorl was breathing heavily. The chest wound has started to hurt again, the bandage must be changed immediately.

The Elixir of Life, which could instantly cure a wound, was left in the bag, and it and other things had to be abandoned when orcs overtook Gorl.

"I should have put it in my waist purse. Praise be to Mendelph, I only managed to get away with a chest wound," Gorl thought. – If that orc's hand had been more precise, I would lie with my throat cut."

"On the other hand, it's a good thing there was an elixir of stamina in the purse, and I could break away from the chase thanks to it. We must get to the Northern Mountains' borders as soon as possible. There should be dwarven strongholds there", – Gorl continued to ponder as he settled down for the night in the hollow of a giant pine tree.

Changing the bandage, Gorl began to go over in his mind the events that had led him into mortal danger. He was all alone and in a land ruled by orcs. 

It all started two months ago when Gorl set off on a dangerous expedition into Northern Horde territory. He had to check the place where the temple of Mendeleth may have been located. A recently discovered ancient map pointed to this location.

Three experienced goblins from the Lonely Moon tribe were given as guides. They knew these northern regions best and could guide him unharmed through these dangerous lands. 

The goblins had traversed the wilderness of the northern countryside for twenty days. Thanks to their trailblazing skills and movement at night, their small group stealthily evaded the orcs that occasionally came their way.

Finally, they reached their destination and came to the remains of stone buildings covered in lush vegetation. Inside the ruins, the goblins found many footprints and old bonfires that the orcs had left behind. Apparently, they sometimes wandered in here when they were hunting.

Having set up camp, the goblins set about exploring the ruins. Gorl determined this was the Temple of Mendeleth, for the surviving characteristic bas-reliefs indicated this.

Inspecting the temple's interior, Gorl discovered a hiding spot where the altar towered. It took him solving the puzzle to open it...

The goblin found an ancient scroll and a metal plate with the Air Symbol. Gorl recognized the plate at once, for he had received a similar one from Sven Torvalson at Dornkun.

After taking what they found, the goblins embarked on their return journey the next day. They were halfway there when orcs ambushed them.

The goblins of the Lonely Moon tribe decided to stay and hold off the orcs, giving the Gorl a chance to break out of the trap. He had to deliver the artifact and the scroll to the elders of the Order at all costs. 

And so, after all these disturbing events, Gorl was a day's journey from the borders of the salvageable Northern Mountains...
