# Extraction Zone
![](cad.2x.png)

*"A gigantic stone building with stained glass windows was the pride of the Pickers buhlag. They set up a greenhouse in no time for their rarest plants. And that meant that the alchemists of Echoron Valley would soon have some much-needed alchemical ingredients..."*

Every alchemist needs a place to cultivate ingredients for their potions. Our game features 10 Extraction Zones, each unlocking with the meta-level of your NFT Alchemist. Some of these zones include:

- Twilight Forest
- Abandoned Mine 
- Swindler’s Swamp
- Desert of Sandworms

…and six more breathtaking locations, meticulously crafted by our artists and narrative designers.

Each zone will have its own unique ingredients, making exploration and advancing through the story of Dji’Da an integral part of your journey.

In the future, you’ll be able to hire an Plodder from the Hall of Elders, who will gladly harvest ingredients for you while you focus on other tasks.
