## The Dark Ages and the Survivor Wars

Dji’Da has changed forever. For hundreds of years, it was immersed in wars, strife, betrayal, and intrigue. The gods were gone, mortals were left to their own devices, and the world was plunged into darkness and blood-filled.

Because of the lack of habitable land and fertile soil, conflicts erupted among recent allies, which developed into the so-called Survivor Wars. Not all the children of the gods got along peacefully in the past, but as long as they were looked after by Elder Tara, these disagreements did not become anything serious. Now that the gods were asleep, nothing could stop mortals from killing each other in bloody wars.

The elves took refuge in the last two remaining forests, where the magical trees that Atanoel, the mother of all elves, had planted still grew. Atanoel’s children began to defend them with passionate fury and kill anyone who tried to cross their borders.

The dwarves retreated into the deep depths of the mountains and shut themselves away in their stone fortresses. There, they could fear no threat from other nations.

And if the elves and dwarves fenced off the world, the people conquered all the old lands. People have built new states on the ruins of ancient kingdoms, endlessly fighting among themselves for power, power, and wealth.

*Refugees in search of a new home*

The children of Mundo, the Orcs, were the strongest warriors of the old world. Rage and stubbornness always burned in their hearts. It was this belief in their power and superiority that was one of the reasons why the Orc lords decided that they were destined to be the new masters of the world.

Following these beliefs, the Orcs began a war against the other nations. Many countries were destroyed by their hands, and the slaughter did not stop until the others united and began to fight them together. Over the centuries, the Orcs have transformed from once great people into savages who have been pushed back to lifeless northern territories and the southern desert continent of Jarah.

Cataclysm and war have not spared the Goblin people either. Many ancient skills have been lost, and many great alchemists have died without passing their wisdom to their apprentices. Powerful potions and rare recipes are lost in the complex entanglements of history.

The goblin people have been shredded. The great talent for alchemy has become rarer and rarer among the new generations. The mastery to create legendary potions has almost disappeared.

Nevertheless, despite all the hardships and difficulties, the prophecy continues to be passed down from generation to generation that one of Mendelef’s children will save this world when the ancient evil returns to Dji’Da…
