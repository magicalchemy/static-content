# Of Magical Creatures. Part V

This information on newfound magical beings is compiled from the few surviving ancient records and supplemented by the research of Vitalius, a member of the Supreme Magical Council of the Academy of Ankorlan, and scholars of the Order of Truth Seekers. The ancient chronicles do not specify for what purposes magical creatures were kept. However, it is undeniable that they were all handheld familiars of the magicians and alchemists of the past.

## Gemosaur

The last of the discovered familiars is quite remarkable. In appearance, it reminds me of a species of rodent found in the forests of the western lands of the Triumvirate of Venturia. Only Gemosaurs are more extensive and have a magical peculiarity inherent in all other familiars.

Gemosaurs got their name following information from extant sources. These creatures can grow minerals on their heads, forming a protective helmet.

At first, the Gemosaurs I observed did not have these mineral growths on their heads, but just a few days later, they began to appear on the heads of all the Gemosaurs I was able to find at that time.

I had assumed that these growths were something like the bone scales of armadillos from the eastern lands of Balkh, but what surprised me was that when it turned out that the specimens I had collected were of mineral origin. My assumptions were confirmed when I asked the alchemists of the Zuun Mercat tribe to test and determine the nature of these specimens.

Their experiments showed that the structure of these minerals resembles artificially grown magic crystals rather than natural mineral formations. At the same time, according to the alchemists, they have a surprisingly complex and pure structure. Even goblins do not always manage to grow such complex crystals in their laboratories.

I am once again convinced of the magical origin of all the familiars found by the goblins, as I cannot otherwise explain how a living organism can grow such things on its body.

Gemosaurs aroused a particular interest on the part of alchemists. During their research, they discovered a truly fantastic thing — these crystals have unique properties. Some alchemists even called them the perfect catalysts for all alchemical processes. Sounds intriguing, whatever that means. I only realized that by using Gemosaurs crystals, one could prepare any magical potion or elixir several times faster…
