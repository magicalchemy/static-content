# The MA Community
![](images/comm.2x.jpg)

We believe that our **community**—the players who have supported our game—is our **greatest asset**. Thanks to you, we’ve gained confidence in our vision and approach to creating Magic Alchemy. Many of your ideas and suggestions have influenced our development process. In a way, our **close-knit community has become a co-author of this game**.

Our project is **fully community-driven**, where members don’t just play for fun and profit, but actively contribute to the creation of their own DAO. This allows players to make meaningful decisions about **the future of the project, new development directions**, and even its final stages, with the ultimate option of **becoming investors in future ventures**.

We are **fully transparent and honest**—we will always share all information regarding the game’s progress and development. **No fabricated stories about ruthless villains, insider schemes, or mysterious hackers—only the truth**. Because at the end of the day, **we’re all in the same boat**, and the team wants this game to **thrive and grow** just as much as every player does.
