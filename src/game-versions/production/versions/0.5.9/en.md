Tormin, Tormin Bayeshall has come through our door,  
With goblin caravans he crossed lands and shore.  
From beyond the blue waves where Bayan’Gol stands tall,  
The call of long wanderings led him to Echorn’s vale,  
Where moonlight on FallenMoon softly shimmers and pales.  

Weary from the road, dust clings to his boots,  
Yet fire lives in his eyes — the thrill of chance and loot.  
Come closer, say “hello”, take a seat at his table slow —  
Sometimes something great begins with words spoken low.
