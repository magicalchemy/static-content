**Withdraw tokens from in-game wallet**

If you accidentally sent USDT or other tokens on the Ethereum, BNB, or Arbitrum network to a wallet created within the game (when logging in via Google or Telegram), you can now withdraw them using a special form:

👉 [magicalchemy.org/world/withdraw](https://magicalchemy.org/world/withdraw)

If the form doesn't support your network — let us know in the Telegram chat [@magicalchemygamechat](https://t.me/magicalchemygamechat), and we'll add it.
